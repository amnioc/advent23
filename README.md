# Advent Of Code 2023 - Nico explores C#

This year I graduated Northcoders Bootcamp as a Junior Software Developer. Here I learnt the foundations of software development and gained a confidence in JavaScript and React.

This December I am taking the opportunity to put my beginner C# knowledge into practice - through puzzles!

I'll be posting some updates on LinkedIn. Hopefully I'll collect all the Stars, but in the meantime - **happy coding!**
